If you have MATLAB 2017 installed then you may open the BlueScope.mlapp file. Else, just open the textualcode.txt file to view the code which contains the same matlab code. 
I have developed this code all by myseld and embedded it into the GUI of Matlab. 
If you go through the code you'll find that the data samples are acquired from the remote device only once when the Push button is pressed. 
So, like whenever the waveform changes you need to click the push button to update the waveform graph. Instead, I want a loop which will keep continuously plotting the data like a live streaming data and a pause button to come out of the loop and view the last updated waveform.
