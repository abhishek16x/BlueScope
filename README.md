# BlueScope
So this is basically a virtual Bluetooth based oscilloscope for real time signals using MATLAB. I have developed an embedded 
device which simply accepts an analog signal and converts it into equivalent digital bytes (Using ADC) and then then transmits
these bytes via Bluetooth to a device(Provided the device should have a bluetooth connectivity). I am accepting these bytes using 
the Bluetooth functionality of MATLAB. And then further plotting the original wave and processing exactly the way a conventional
benchtop oscilloscope would do.
